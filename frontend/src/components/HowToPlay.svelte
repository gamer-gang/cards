      of the room with computers).
    </li>
    <li>The deck is shuffled and all cards are dealt to the 4 players.</li>
    <li>The player with the 3 of spades goes first.</li>

    <h3>Starting a turn</h3>
    <li>
      If there are no cards on the table/stack, you can play any number of any cards, but you cannot
      play different cards (i.e. three jacks is valid, but placing 4, 5, and 6 isn't).
    </li>
    <li>
      The next player can play a card of the same quanitity and the same or higher value. (i.e. if
      the first player places two fives ðŸ‚¥ ðŸ‚µ, you may only place two same/higher value cards like two
      sixes ðŸƒ† ðŸƒ–). You may also pass your turn.
    </li>
    <li>
      Card hierarchy is A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, ace being highest and 3 being lowest. 2
      is special and is used for flushing.
    </li>

    <h3>Ending a turn</h3>
    <li>Turns keep going until everyone else passes.</li>
    <li>
      If everyone passes their turn, the pile is cleared and the player who last played goes first.
    </li>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Flushing</h3>
    <li>Playing a 2 flushes (clears) the card pile.</li>
    <li>
      If a card is on the top of the pile and you have enough cards to complete the set of 4 (make
      the top 4 cards the same), you may place then and flush the pile even if it is not your turn.
    </li>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Reversal</h3>
    <li>
      Placing a duplicate of a card will reverse the turn order (e.g. if there is a 3 on the pile
      and you place another 3, the turn order will reverse).
    </li>
