# Flushed!

An online card game based on president. 

dependencies are in the package.json files.

You will need to download nodejs and yarn.

## Inspiration

The card game President inspired this project. My friends and I used to play it all the time, but because of the ongoing pandemic we could not meet up anymore. My team decided that we should make an online version, so anyone all over the world can have fun playing cards. 

## What it does

Flushed lets you play a card game in real time online. 

## How I built it

We used Nodejs, Expressjs, Socket.io, and Webpack for the server and Svelte, Snowpack, and Typescript for the frontend. 

## Challenges I ran into

I was new to svelte, so I had trouble starting with it. We also ran into many problems with our game logic, like how sometimes bots would suddenly decide to get stuck in a loop or play wrong cards. CSS and getting pages to look right was also something we struggled with. 

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of

I am proud of learning svelte and completing the project. 

## What I learned

I learned how to use svelte and snowpack, and my teammate learned how to make real time applications with socket.io. 

## What's next for Flushed

Some features from President still are not implemented, like interrupting turns with flushes. Another feature we had to cut was spectating games, so you could watch how friends play. Flushed still has room to grow.
